helm-project-operator
========

This repo contains a set of two interlinked projects:

- The **Helm Project Operator** is a generic design for a Kubernetes Operator that acts on `ProjectHelmChart` CRs.
- **Helm Locker** is a Kubernetes operator that prevents resource drift on (i.e. "locks") Kubernetes objects that are tracked by Helm 3 releases.

**Note: These project are not intended for standalone use.** 

For more info on _Helm Locker_, see the [dedicated README file](README-helm-locker.md).

Helm Project Operator is intended to be implemented by a Project Operator (e.g. [`rancher/prometheus-federator`](https://github.com/rancher/prometheus-federator)) but provides a common definition for all Project Operators to use in order to support deploy specific, pre-bundled Helm charts (tied to a unique registered `spec.helmApiVersion` associated with the operator) across all project namespaces detected by this operator.

## Getting Started

For more information, see the [Getting Started guide](docs/helm-project-operator/gettingstarted.md).

## Developing

### Which branch do I make changes on?

Helm Project Operator is built and released off the contents of the `main` branch. To make a contribution, open up a PR to the `main` branch.

For more information, see the [Developing guide](docs/helm-project-operator/developing.md).

## Design

Helm Project Operator is built on top of [k3s-io/helm-controller](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller) and [rancher/helm-locker](https://github.com/rancher/helm-locker). For more information on the design of the underlying components, please see the `README.md` on their respective repositories.

For an example of how Helm Project Operator can be implemented, please see [`rancher/prometheus-federator`](https://github.com/rancher/prometheus-federator).

For more information in general, please see [docs/design.md](docs/helm-project-operator/design.md).
